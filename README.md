# Operation: Breathe

A resource and virtual community for cystic fibrosis patients.

## Planned stack

- React w/ TypeScript
- Redux
- Node/Express
- Mongo
- Some sort of CMS (Prismic or Contentful, most likely)
- Eventually want to convert this to a mobile app, so either React Native or Swift (or both).

## My goals for this project

- Build out a blog (with the help of some sort of CMS, ideally) so I can write articles to share with fellow patients.
- Include tips from the community for how to cope with CF.
- Potentially build out some sort of "chat" feature, although... that could get really interesting, really fast. Will think about this more. :)
- Include a way for users to track calorie intake, water intake, exercise for the week, and potentially some other health stats (although, again, HIPAA compliance might be biting off more than I can chew).
